## SDLC, Agile, and other engineering methodologies

The **systems development life cycle** describes a process for planning, creating, and testing an information system. It provides a sensible approach to projects that have more complexity than a personal or brochure website. A static website is one thing, but as soon as there's a need for data storage or user authentication, we're talking about a system.

It is ideal to use the right language early and often when discussing these types of projects so that the labor involved & requirements for success are apparent to all parties. It is crucial for clientele transform their understanding of what a website or application is in order to budget appropriately and achieve the results they really want.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle), 
>*The systems development lifecycle concept applies to a range of hardware and software configurations, as a system can be 
>composed of hardware only, software only, or a combination of both.*

This can be a more accurate way to describe and plan projects that are more complex than a personal or small business website because they tend to have more technical requirements -- for example, search indexing or scalability.

SDLC is *not* the only way to develop software, but it includes many common methodologies with varying pros/cons. It describes not one, but several methodologies [Waterfall, Spiral, etc.] 

The most common alternative is what is known as *agile* methodology, which has become increasingly popular. **Agile methodology** is primarily characterized by sprints, which are typically a period of 2 weeks. Tasks are organized into the sprints using a project board [JIRA is a popular choice.] I really like agile methodology because timeboxing groups of tasks makes it easier to hit milestones and identify blockers. 

Agile methodology is also characterized by frequent meetings and an emphasis on communication, and tends to work best with a client-side resource who can participate as needed.
